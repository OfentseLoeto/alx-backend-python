*PROJECT DESCRIPTION*

- This project focuses on mastering Python decorators to enhance database operations in Python applications.
- Create custom decorators to log queries,
   * handle connections, manage transactions,
   * retry failed operations, and cache query results.
- The tasks are designed to simulate real-world challenges, with an in-depth understanding of Python’s capabilities for dynamic and reusable code in database management.

*LEARNING OBJECTIVES*:

- Deepen their knowledge of Python decorators:
   * And how they can be used to create reusable, efficient, and clean code.
- Enhance database management skills:
   * By automating repetitive tasks like connection handling, logging, and caching.
- Implement robust transaction management techniques:
   * To ensure data integrity and handle errors gracefully.
- Optimize database queries:
   * By leveraging caching mechanisms to reduce redundant calls.
- Build resilience into database operations:
   * By implementing retry mechanisms for transient errors.
- Apply best practices in database interaction:
   * For scalable and maintainable Python applications.
